# AtomCore

This is the semester-long project for my Advanced Web Programming class at university. It's a prototype for a chemical supplies' webstore. <br>

The website has the following features so far:
- Login and sign up
- Adding products to database
- Getting products from database
- Adding products to shopping cart

The website uses Firebase for database storage and authentication. Pinia for state handling and the Vue framework. <br>
Also, I used the Sass preprocessor and the Underscore library to handle sorting.
